      <h1>Fractal Fantasy vs Limp Body Beat</h1>
      <div class="container">
        <section class="info">
          <h2>Information Design</h2>
          <p>
            Fractal Fantasy and Limp Body Beat take different approaches to how
            its information is structured and presented on the screen. Fractal
            Fantasy (FF) puts a visual experience over clarity, by prioritizing
            the full-screen visuals with only a small control panel at the top
            right. The minimal text supports the immersiveness of the reactive
            visuals, but sacrifices clarity on the controls. The technical
            terminology of "lookupRadius / delay feedback" makes it confusing
            and slightly intimidating at first glance as theres no other
            information given. In contrast with this, Limp Body Beat (LBB)
            visually overwhlems the user with a chaotic and disorganized UI.
            There is very little written information or guidance on what to do
            and how to interact with the website, and users are expected to
            interact with the environment through exploration. Although this
            supports the overall tone of the website, it may confuse first-time
            users or people unfamiliar with music interfaces. Both websites
            prioritise visuals over clarity, but FF offers a collapsable control
            panel to guide the viewers (like an interactive art piece), while
            LBB leans into confusion as part of its creative identity.

          <h2>Mapping</h2>
          <p>
            The mapping also differs between the two website UI's. Fractal
            Fantasy (FF) uses sliders to map continious values to audiovisual
            paramteres, like the mouse size affecting vibrato rate, etc. There
            mappings follow the natural conventions, making it intuitive for all
            users. Although the labels use technical jargon as mentioned before,
            FF offers real-time feedback to help reinforce what each control
            does. In constrast, Limp Body Beat (LBB) relies more on binary
            mapping, which is a convention you would expect with a music
            sequencer. Both UI's are familiar and easy to grasp, the key
            difference is ease of discovery. The sequencer isn't immediately
            visible, and the user has to scroll and click around to find it.
            FF's controls are accessible but minimal, while LBB hides its key
            interactions. This highlights different design priorities, FF wants
            user to understand and control the website with ease, while LBB
            wants users to experiment and explore.

          <h2>Characterization</h2>
          <p>
            The tone and personality of both sites are extremely visually
            distinctive. Fractal Fantasy (FF) is polished, futuristic and
            immersive with its reflective visuals and minimal styling to give it
            a sci-fi and sleek vibe. Everything is consistent and the overall
            tone feels refined. In contrast, Limp Body Beat (LBB) leans towards
            a more bizarre and crazy tone. The floating body that reacts to
            beats and the hand-drawn, messy interface makes the UI have a
            chaotic and humorous feel. The cartoon aesthetic is unpredictable
            and comedic, which is part of its charm and brand. FF presents
            itself like a digital installation with a focus on artistic
            curiosity, while LBB encourages users to treat the experience as fun
            and not to take it too seriously. Both are well executed for its
            intended design and take completely different approaches and
            aesthetics.

          <h2>Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            Fractal Fantasy's (FF) feedback is subtle but effective to reinforce
            its immersive tone. Adjusting any of the sliders in the control
            panel immediately affects the visuals and audio in a smooth and
            responsive way. Doing this make the changes feel natural, especially
            that when you change the sliders, the interface continues to animate
            and evolve, even without moving the mouse. This kind of feedback
            makes the website feel alive and reactive, and rewarding user
            interaction, encouraging them to explore more. To contrast, Limp
            Body Beat (LBB) is all about exaggerated and immediate responses.
            When you click buttons, something lights up, moves or changes. The
            beat sequencer is is entertaining as even simply pressing the button
            makes a musical sound, even if the sequencer isn't up to that part
            yet. The floating body flails around in sync with the beat and gives
            users a sense of rhythm in a comedic and bizarre tone. While this
            heigtens engagement, users may struggle to figure out which button
            makes what sound, and get overwhelmed with its crazy movements. Both
            UI's provide consistent feedback systems, but has different oucomes,
            FF encouraging controlled input and analyzation of the effects, and
            LBB encourages fast clicking and playing around to see the body jolt
            around and see what noises you can make from it.
